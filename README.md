# 5DOF_Robotic_Arm_Design
##Project description:
A 5-DOF robotic arm designed using Tinkercad, ending with an open socket gripper holding a yellow ball to represent object handling. The design is simple and reflects a basic understanding of robotic arm structure.

##Purpose:
The purpose this robotic arm is to simulate object handling and demonstrate the basic movements principles of robotic joins using a 5-DOF stracture.

##Degrees of Freedom â€“ Joint Movements:

1.** Base Rotation:** Rotates the entire arm left and right.
2.** Shoulder Pitch:** Moves the arm up and down from the base.
3.** Elbow Pitch:** Bends the arm forward and backward like an elbow.
4.** Wrist Pitch:** Tilts the end of the arm to adjust the gripper angle.
5.** Gripper (Socket):** A fixed open shape that holds the ball to simulate object grasping.
